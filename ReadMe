Hello All,

I'm uploading my technical Assessment for Neuroflow's Data Analyst position here.

Part one took me about three hours, and completing part 2 without outside help would have taken much longer, since my SQL skills aren't really where they need to be. That said, I might add to this project in the future if only for my own educational benefit.

My general conclusion for Part 1 was that a clustered heatmap may be the best way for caregivers to visualizer the data.

Please don't hesitate to message or email me with any questions!

Sincerely,

Nicholas Mann
